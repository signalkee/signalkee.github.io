**PI**: Dr. Seok-Jun Bu (Now Professor at Gyeongsang National University)

**Achievement**: 

(1) **Robin Inho Kee**, Dahyun Nam, SeokJun Bu, “Disentangled Prototyping with Triplet-trained Prototypical Network for Few-shot Learning in In-vehicle Noise Classification”, IEEE Access, 2024

**Project 1**: **Disentangled Prototyping with Triplet-trained Prototypical Network for Few-shot Learning in In-vehicle Noise Classification**

**Primary Motivation**: In rural areas where facilities or experts are scarce, research needs to be conducted remotely or with assistance. Therefore, We have pioneered lab automation that allows a mobile manipulator to conduct laboratory research autonomously. This study included various aspects of the robot laboratory, such as preparation to analysis, control and integration of data, and production.

**What I did**: Everything!

**What I did**: Almost everything!



**Project 2**: **Dynamic Prototype-guided Memory Replay for In-Vehicle Noise Classification**

**Primary Motivation**: In rural areas where facilities or experts are scarce, research needs to be conducted remotely or with assistance. Therefore, We have pioneered lab automation that allows a mobile manipulator to conduct laboratory research autonomously. This study included various aspects of the robot laboratory, such as preparation to analysis, control and integration of data, and production.

**What I did**: Developed baseline code and implementated the memory replay algorithm
