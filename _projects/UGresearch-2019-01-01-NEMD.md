**Nano Electromechanical Device Lab**, School of Mechnical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea
PI: Professor Seong Chan, Jun, Dr. Sehong Park
Project: **Thin film display application using graphene Fresnel zone plate based the multi view lens and acoustic lens**


**Achievement**: Youngho Seo, Hyeseong Lee, **Inho Kee**, Gilho Lee, Seongchan Jun, “Manufacturing Method of Multi-Gas Sensor Using Ultra-Thin Film Lens”, Korean patent 10-2019-0044429


**Primary Motivation**: The display is being developed to enable the transmission of synesthesia, such as expressing a large amount of information and 3D images without glass and sounds. Lenticular lens or parallax barrier technology is required to implement glassless 3D and multi view display. However, it is Difficult to implement high resolution and slim design.


**Target Application**: Dual view display needing viewing angle control

    The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)-grown graphene was transferred onto a piece of glass using a PMMA coating, and a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) was used for patterning the lens. The intensity distribution of our graphene FZP was examined for different numbers of layers, and the contrast and concentration are enhanced by increasing the number of graphene layers.
