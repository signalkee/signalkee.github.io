**<a href='https://kbd.yonsei.ac.kr/'>Knowledge Based Design Lab</a>**, School of Mechnical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea

**PI**: Professor Soo-Hong Lee

**Project**: **Smart Lock-out/Tag-out in Engineering Plants (P&ID)**

**Achievement**: Woojin Jo, Sehyun Hwang, **Inho Kee**, Soohong Lee, “An Intelligent Lock-Out Tag-Out System for Monitoring and Control of the Locked Device”, IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) 2019

**Primary Motivation**: The display is being developed to enable the transmission of synesthesia, such as expressing a large amount of information and 3D images without glass and sounds. Lenticular lens or parallax barrier technology is required to implement glassless 3D and multi view display. However, it is Difficult to implement high resolution and slim design.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
