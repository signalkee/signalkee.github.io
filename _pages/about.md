Hello, I'm Robin Inho Kee, a second-year Master's student in <a href='https://me.engin.umich.edu/'>Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan</a>, where I began my studies in August 2023.

Iâ€™m fortunate to work as a research intern in <a href='https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/'>VODKA lab</a> having Professor <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/kolmanovsky/'>Ilya Kolmanovsky</a> and Professor <a href='https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/'>Anouck Girard</a> as my advisors.

My research focuses on developing **learning-based safety-critical control for constrained systems** by leveraging formal methods from both **control theory** and **machine learning**.
This work has practical applications particularly in the fields of aerospace, robotics, and automotive domains.

Before joining the University of Michigan, I was a research intern at the AI & Robotics Institute of the <a href='https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#firstPage'>Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</a> in South Korea. Check out my work at KIST <a href='https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Work%20experience'>here</a>.

I completed my undergraduate degree in <a href='https://me.yonsei.ac.kr/me_en/index.do'>Mechanical Engineering at Yonsei University</a>, where I engaged in various research and projects. Learn more about my <a href='https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Undergraduate%20research%20projects'>research experience</a> and <a href='https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Undergraduate%20projects'>projects</a>.

Outside of academics, I enjoy lifting weights and listening to music. I also served as a Staff Sergeant in the Intelligence Agency with the Republic of Korea Air Force, fulfulling my mandatory military service.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my research or connect: ``inhokee@umich.edu``!
