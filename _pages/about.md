Hi, my name is Robin Inho Kee. 

I'm currently a second-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I started in August 2023. 

Iâ€™m fortunate to work as a research intern in <a href='https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/'>VODKA lab</a> having <a href='https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/'>Professor Anouck Girard</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/kolmanovsky/'>Professor Ilya Kolmanovsky</a> as my advisors. 

My research focuses on developing **safety-guaranteed control for constrained systems** by leveraging formal methods from both **control theory** and **machine learning**. 
This work has practical applications in robotic systems, particularly in the fields of spacecraft and automotive engineering. 

Aside from my research, I enjoy lifting weights and listening to music. 

If you'd like to discuss my research further, feel free to reach out at ``inhokee@umich.edu``!
