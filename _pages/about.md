Hello, I'm **Robin Inho Kee**, a 1st year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/">Robotics at the University of Michigan</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://vasileiostzoumas.com/">Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Laboratory (iRaL)</a> led by Professor <a href="https://vasileiostzoumas.com/">Vasileios Tzoumas</a>. My research focuses on **rapid and safe active situational awareness with multiple robots**, combining **control theory** and **machine learning**.

I am fortunate to be fully supported by the <a href="https://www.draper.com/education-programs/draper-scholars-program">Draper Scholar Program</a> for my work on decentralized multi-agent control for situational awareness. Many thanks to the <a href="https://www.draper.com/">Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://www.draper.com/education-programs/draper-scholars-program/research-topics?tab=26905">Dr. Begum Cannataro</a> for this opportunity.

Previously, I completed my Masterâ€™s in <a href="https://me.engin.umich.edu/">Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan</a>, where I worked on **learning-based safety-critical control** under Professors <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/kolmanovsky/">Ilya Kolmanovsky</a>, <a href="https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/">Anouck Girard</a>, and <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~dpanagou/">Dimitra Panagou</a>. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://me.yonsei.ac.kr/me_en/index.do">Mechanical Engineering at Yonsei University</a> and was a research intern at the <a href="https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#firstPage">Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</a>.

Outside of research, I enjoy weightlifting

and music. I also served as a Staff Sergeant in the Intelligence Agency with the <a href="https://www.airforce.mil.kr/user/indexMain.action?command=&siteId=airforce-eng">Republic of Korea Air Force</a>, fulfilling my mandatory military service.
