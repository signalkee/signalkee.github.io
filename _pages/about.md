Hello, I'm **Robin Inho Kee**, an incoming Ph.D. student in <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/">Robotics at the University of Michigan</a>. Starting this fall, I will join the <a href="https://vasileiostzoumas.com/">Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Laboratory (iRaL)</a> under Professor <a href="https://vasileiostzoumas.com/">Vasileios Tzoumas</a>. My research interests include **rapid and safe active situational awareness with multiple robots**, employing formal methods from **control theory** and **machine learning**.

Previously, I pursued my Masterâ€™s degree in <a href="https://me.engin.umich.edu/">Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan</a>, where I conducted research under Professors <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/kolmanovsky/">Ilya Kolmanovsky</a> and <a href="https://vodca.engin.umich.edu/">Anouck Girard</a>, and also collaborated with Professor <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~dpanagou/">Dimitra Panagou</a>. My work focused on **learning-based safety-critical control** for constrained systems, with applications in aerospace, robotics, and automotive domains.

Before that, I was a research intern at the AI & Robotics Institute of the <a href="https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#firstPage">Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</a>. Check out my KIST experience <a href="https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Work%20experience">here</a>.

I completed my undergraduate studies in <a href="https://me.yonsei.ac.kr/me_en/index.do">Mechanical Engineering at Yonsei University</a>, engaging in various research and projects. Feel free to learn more about my <a href="https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Undergraduate%20research%20projects">research experience</a> and <a href="https://signalkee.github.io/Researches%20&%20Projects/#Undergraduate%20projects">projects</a>.

Outside of academics, I enjoy lifting weights

and listening to music. I also served as a Staff Sergeant in the Intelligence Agency with the Republic of Korea Air Force, fulfilling my mandatory military service.
